# Financial Mathematical Models
Popular models used in Financial Engineering and Computation textbook from Yuh-Dauh Lyuu. We will use Jupyter notebook for most concepts and patterns that are illustrated in this textbook 

# 1. Stochastic Process and Brownian Motion
#### * Stochastic Integrals
####   Using stochastic integrals, let's model the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Ito process, and Martingales.                                   
#### * Geometric Brownian Motion
#### * Brownian Motion Variants

# 2. Binomial Modeling
#### * Put Options using Asset Pricing Model
#### * Binomial Asset Pricing Model

# 3. Continuous-Time Derivatives Pricing
#### * Black-Scholes
#### * Implied Volatility
#### * Options Theory with Black-Scholes Model
