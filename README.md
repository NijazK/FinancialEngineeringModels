# Financial Mathematical Models
Popular models used in Financial Engineering and Computation textbook from Yuh-Dauh Lyuu. We will use Jupyter notebook for most concepts and patterns that are illustrated in this textbook 

## 1. Stochastic Process and Brownian Motion
###  Stochastic Integrals
#####   Using stochastic integrals, let's model the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Ito process, and Martingales.                                   
###  Geometric Brownian Motion
#####   Simulation of symmtetric and scaled random walks, as well as Binomial distribution in discretre and continuous time.
###  Brownian Motion Variants
#####   Brownian motion in a guassian incrementation.

## 2. Binomial Modeling
###  Put Options using Asset Pricing Model
###  Binomial Asset Pricing Model

## 3. Continuous-Time Derivatives Pricing
###  Black-Scholes
###  Implied Volatility
###  Options Theory with Black-Scholes Model
