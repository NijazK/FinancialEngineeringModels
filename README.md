# Financial Mathematical Models
Popular models used in Financial Engineering and Computation textbook from Yuh-Dauh Lyuu. We will use Jupyter notebook for most concepts and patterns that are illustrated in this textbook 

## 1. Stochastic Process and Brownian Motion
###  1. Stochastic Integrals
#####     Using stochastic integrals, let's model the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, Ito process, and Martingales.                                   
###  2. Geometric Brownian Motion
#####     Simulation of symmtetric and scaled random walks, as well as Binomial distribution in discretre and continuous time.
###  3. Brownian Motion Variants
#####     Brownian motion in a guassian incrementation.

## 2. Binomial Modeling
###  1. Put Options using Asset Pricing Model
###  1. Binomial Asset Pricing Model

## 3. Continuous-Time Derivatives Pricing
###  1. Black-Scholes
###  2. Implied Volatility
###  3. Options Theory with Black-Scholes Model
